We are use the `fetch` method of the global `window` object to make the request, and wrap it in a promise.\n\nOperations in the code include:\n\n1. Listening for user inputs and button click events as observables using the `fromEvent` creation method.\n2. Merging the two input event streams using the `merge` method, and mapping the event streams to objects using the `map` operator.\n3. 'Switching' to a new observable every time a user input comes in using the `switchMap` operator.\n4. Combining the latest values from each observable using the `combineLatest` function.\n5. Projecting the data from the resulting observable and handling errors using operators such as `tap`, `map`, and `catchError`.\n6. Subscribing to the resulting observable stream and logging the data received, or errors that are thrown.\n\nRemember that this code requires a compatible environment - a modern browser or a Node.js setup with appropriate polyfills and transpiler settings to run. Also, it depends on the web page containing certain HTML elements with given IDs."

It demonstrates a good understanding of creating observables from events, merging multiple observables, and handling asynchronous operations with switchMap, which are all common RxJS idiomatic ways of handling multiple streams of data.\n\nHowever, for a complete 10, the code could be refactored and improved for better error handling, and more sophisticated use of operators could be employed. For instance, the error handling within the `requestUsers` function and `subscribe` block could be enhanced. The use of TypeScript could also be improved to provide stricter type checking in several places.\n\nAs always, idiomaticity also somewhat depends on conventions and practices used in a certain team or project."

Choose the Downstream: Once you have the list ready, you can choose any downstream for testing. Ideally, you would want to choose a downstream that is least likely to affect your productivity if something goes wrong.\n\n3. Change the Routing Configuration: Depending on the technology you're using, find the configuration file or settings page where you can edit the routes. This can usually involve two parts one is where the routing path is defined and one is where the target (downstream) is specified.\n\n4. Redirect the Traffic: Change the downstream server route to your desired route and save the changes.\n\n5. Evaluate: You should then monitor the changes to ensure the routing is working as expected. Detailing logs or using monitoring tools can help in this regard.\n\n6. Test: After ensuring that the configuration has worked, start testing your downstream routing handling code.\n\nThis is quite a generic guide as the specific process can be different due to the potential complexity and differences of systems. It would be more helpful if you could specify the technology you're using for a more specific guide."

Magnesium is also linked to the bone structure development process and aids energy production. Magnesium deficiency, although rare, might lead to conditions like muscle cramps, mental disorders, osteoporosis, and high blood pressure. Magnesium toxicity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms such as digestive problems, lethargy, and irregular heartbeat. Genetic factors such as innate vitamin D metabolism or absorption rate may affect magnesium uptake and usage, as can environmental factors like soil composition. The optimal dietary magnesium/calcium intake ratio is about 1:2. Magnesium’s absorption can be impeded by an excessive intake of dietary fiber, and it works together with Vitamin D, Vitamin K, and Calcium for optimum bone health. Therefore, while planning for a balanced diet, the significance of embracing an optimal ratio of these vitamins and minerals can't be stressed enough."

The nutrient's significant roles within our body include facilitating protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. It also contributes to the construction of our bone structure and the production of energy. Despite being relatively rare, a deficiency in magnesium can cause symptoms such as muscle cramps, mental disorders, osteoporosis, and high blood pressure. Conversely, an overabundance, or toxicity, could result in digestive issues, lethargy, and irregular heartbeat. Both genetic and environmental factors, such as inborn Vitamin D metabolism rates or the soil composition of the food we consume, can impact uptake and usage of magnesium. The dietary ratio for optimal magnesium to calcium intake stands at approximately 1:2. Excessive dietary fiber intake can hinder the absorption of magnesium. Furthermore, for steadfast bone health, magnesium needs to work synergistically with Vitamin D, Vitamin K, and Calcium. Maintaining a balanced diet with these nutrients in their appropriate proportions is crucial for optimal health."

We are use the `fetch` method of the global `window` object to make the request, and wrap it in a promise.\n\nOperations in the code include:\n\n1. Listening for user inputs and button click events as observables using the `fromEvent` creation method.\n2. Merging the two input event streams using the `merge` method, and mapping the event streams to objects using the `map` operator.\n3. 'Switching' to a new observable every time a user input comes in using the `switchMap` operator.\n4. Combining the latest values from each observable using the `combineLatest` function.\n5. Projecting the data from the resulting observable and handling errors using operators such as `tap`, `map`, and `catchError`.\n6. Subscribing to the resulting observable stream and logging the data received, or errors that are thrown.\n\nRemember that this code requires a compatible environment - a modern browser or a Node.js setup with appropriate polyfills and transpiler settings to run. Also, it depends on the web page containing certain HTML elements with given IDs."

It demonstrates a good understanding of creating observables from events, merging multiple observables, and handling asynchronous operations with switchMap, which are all common RxJS idiomatic ways of handling multiple streams of data.\n\nHowever, for a complete 10, the code could be refactored and improved for better error handling, and more sophisticated use of operators could be employed. For instance, the error handling within the `requestUsers` function and `subscribe` block could be enhanced.

This could be a server or device in your network that will receive the traffic.\n\n2. Ping the Downstream\nTo ensure that your device can reach the destination, ping that device. This simply involves typing \"ping\" followed by the IP address into your command prompt. A successful ping means your device is able to reach the destination.\n\n3. Review Your Current Routes\nReview your current routing table. You can access this by typing \"route print\" or \"netstat -r\" into your command prompt. This returns a list of destinations and their associated routers (gateways).\n\n4. Add the Route \nIf the destination isn't included in your current routing table, you need to add it. Type \"route add\" followed by the destination IP address, then the mask, and finally the gateway IP address.\n\nFor example: `route add 192.0.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 192.0.2.1`\n\nThis command tells your computer to direct all traffic for the destination (192.0.2.0) through the gateway (192.0.2.1).\n\n5. Test the Route\nOnce you've added the route, you'll want to test it. Simply try to send a packet to the destination from your device. This will travel through the gateway you've specified.\n\nPlease note that some commands may vary depending on the operating system. Make sure to replace the IP addresses in the example with the actual downstream IP addresses."

Magnesium deficiency, although rare, might lead to conditions like muscle cramps, mental disorders, osteoporosis, and high blood pressure. Magnesium toxicity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms such as digestive problems, lethargy, and irregular heartbeat. Genetic factors such as innate vitamin D metabolism or absorption rate may affect magnesium uptake and usage, as can environmental factors like soil composition. The optimal dietary magnesium/calcium intake ratio is about 1:2. Magnesium’s absorption can be impeded by an excessive intake of dietary fiber, and it works together with Vitamin D, Vitamin K, and Calcium for optimum bone health. Therefore, while planning for a balanced diet, the significance of embracing an optimal ratio of these vitamins and minerals can't be stressed enough."

Magnesium is also linked to the bone structure development process and aids energy production. Magnesium deficiency, although rare, might lead to conditions like muscle cramps, mental disorders, osteoporosis, and high blood pressure. Magnesium toxicity, on the other hand, can cause symptoms such as digestive problems, lethargy, and irregular heartbeat. Genetic factors such as innate vitamin D metabolism or absorption rate may affect magnesium uptake and usage, as can environmental factors like soil composition. The optimal dietary magnesium/calcium intake ratio is about 1:2. Magnesium’s absorption can be impeded by an excessive intake of dietary fiber, and it works together with Vitamin D, Vitamin K, and Calcium for optimum bone health. Therefore, while planning for a balanced diet, the significance of embracing an optimal ratio of these vitamins and minerals can't be stressed enough."

Identify the Number of Downstreams: The first step involves identifying how many downstream infrastructures are available for rerouting the traffic.\n\n2. Choose the Downstream: Once you have the list ready, you can choose any downstream for testing. Ideally, you would want to choose a downstream that is least likely to affect your productivity if something goes wrong.\n\n3. Change the Routing Configuration: Depending on the technology you're using, find the configuration file or settings page where you can edit the routes. This can usually involve two parts one is where the routing path is defined and one is where the target (downstream) is specified.\n\n4. Redirect the Traffic: Change the downstream server route to your desired route and save the changes.\n\n5. Evaluate: You should then monitor the changes to ensure the routing is working as expected. Detailing logs or using monitoring tools can help in this regard.\n\n6. Test: After ensuring that the configuration has worked, start testing your downstream routing handling code.\n\nThis is quite a generic guide as the specific process can be different due to the potential complexity and differences of systems. It would be more helpful if you could specify the technology you're using for a more specific guide."

Create Route:\nOnce you've chosen a downstream, you can now create a route to it. This would typically involve setting up an HTTP, TCP, or another type of connection to the downstream, and would involve taking into account network and performance considerations. You might also have to create routing rules if you're using a router or load balancer.\n\n4. Send the Request:\nAfter creating the route, you can send off the request to the chosen downstream.
