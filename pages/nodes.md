- Nodes are the building blocks of the system, each node represents a unit of computation that can be connected to form a data processing pipeline.
- Each node can have multiple roles, such as `process`, `ingress`, `egress`, and `transform`, which determine the type of operations it can perform.
- Nodes can be connected to each other through their `upstream$` and `downstream$` properties, allowing for the flow of data between them.
- The `process` role of a node is where the main data processing occurs, using a process operator to transform the incoming data.
- The `ingress` role is responsible for handling incoming data, possibly from external sources, and preparing it for processing.
- The `egress` role manages the output of processed data, directing it to its final destination or another node for further processing.
- The `transform` role applies additional transformations to the data after processing, such as formatting or filtering, before it reaches the egress point.
- Nodes are designed to be modular and reusable, allowing developers to create complex systems by connecting different nodes with specific roles and capabilities.
