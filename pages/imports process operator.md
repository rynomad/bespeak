## Introduction
The "Memoized Imports" operator is designed to efficiently handle the importation of modules by memoizing the results. This process operator is particularly useful in scenarios where modules are repeatedly imported, as it caches the imported modules to avoid redundant network requests or processing. It is applicable in systems that dynamically load modules at runtime and require optimization to improve performance.
- ## Operator Identification
- **Key**: `imports`
- **Version**: `0.0.1`
- **Description**:  imports takes a module document and returns a memoized import
- ## Dependencies
- **rxjs**: A library for reactive programming using Observables, to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. [RxJS Documentation](https://rxjs.dev/guide/overview)
- ## Schema Definitions
- **Input Schema**:
	- Type: `object`
	- Properties:
		- `id`: A string identifier for the module.
		- `data`: A string containing the module data.
- **Output Schema**:
	- an imported module
- **Config Schema**:
	- There is no config schema
- **Keys Schema**:
	- There is no keys schema
- ## Operator Components
- **Setup Operator**:
	- setup memoization
- **Tool Operator**:
	- N/A
- **Status Operator**:
	- N/A
- ## Process Operator Logic
- The operator works by taking a module document, checking if the module has already been memoized, and if not, creating a blob from the module data, generating a URL for the blob, and dynamically importing the module. The imported module is then memoized to optimize subsequent imports. Since importing is async, the import promise should be memoized immediately and then awaited when returned to avoid race conditions causing multiple imports.
