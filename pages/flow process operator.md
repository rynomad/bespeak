# Requirements Document for Process Operator Development
- ## Introduction
  The process operator to be developed is designed to take a serialized flow of nodes, along with their configuration, system, and key data, and construct a flow out of them. This operator will be a crucial component in managing and orchestrating the flow of data between different nodes in a system.
- ## Operator Identification
- **Key**: FlowConstructor
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Description**: This operator takes a serialized flow of nodes, along with their associated configuration, system, and key data, and constructs a flow out of them.
- ## Dependencies
- This operator relies on the following external dependencies:
- ## Schema Definitions
- **Config Schema**: The configuration used to construct an instance of this operator includes the serialized flow of nodes. This includes a list of nodes and a list of connections between these nodes. Each node is represented as an object with properties for the node's configuration and system data.
	- each node will have a `name` in its system data that can be used to reference the node in connections. The `id` of each internal node will be `flowId-name`.
- **Keys Schema**: The keys shared by all instances of this operator include a key for every name@version combination found in the config nodes. These keys could be API keys or other credentials required to interact with external systems or services.
	- The keys schema is constructed dynamically based on the value of the config
- **Input Schema**: an object with `id` and `payload`, payload must match the input schema of the given internal node. The input is routed to the appropriate internal node
	- The input schema is constructed dynamically based on the value of the config
- **Output Schema**: on object with id and payload, any time any internal node emits, the output is reflected on the flow output
	- The output schema is constructed dynamically based on the value of the config
- ## Operator Components
- **Status Operator**: The status operator will mirror the status events of every internal node. it will augment the `detail` property with the id of the internal node that created the event.
- ## Process Operator Logic
- The process operator will start constructing each of the [[nodes]] and writing their respective system, process:config, and process:keys data. then for each connection it will provide the
- ## Logging
  The operator will log information at various levels to help with debugging and performance monitoring. This includes:
- **Debug**: Detailed information about the flow construction process for debugging purposes.
- **Info**: High-level information about the progress of the flow construction.
- **Error**: Information about any errors that occur during the flow construction.
