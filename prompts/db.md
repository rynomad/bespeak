Primary Functional Requirements

1. The module is required to create and manage a database using the RxDB library. This includes creating the database in either IndexedDB (if available) or in-memory, and adding collections to the database.

2. The module is required to provide an operator function (dbOperation) that performs a series of operations on the database. These operations are specified as an array of objects, each containing an operation type, a collection name, and parameters for the operation. The operations are performed on the specified collection in the database, and the result of each operation is ensured to be an Observable.

Dependencies other than rxjs

1. rxdb: This is the main library used for creating and managing the database.

2. rxdb/plugins/dev-mode: This plugin is used to enable development mode in RxDB.

3. rxdb/plugins/storage-dexie: This plugin is used to create a Dexie-based storage for the database, which is used when IndexedDB is available.

4. rxdb/plugins/storage-memory: This plugin is used to create an in-memory storage for the database, which is used when IndexedDB is not available.

Input Schema

- An array of operations to be performed on the database. Each operation is an object with the following properties:
  - operation: The operation to be performed. Can be 'findOne', 'upsert', or 'patch'.
  - collection: The collection on which the operation is to be performed.
  - params: The parameters for the operation.

Config Schema

- An object with the following properties:
  - dbName: The name of the database.
  - collections: The rxDB configuration for the collections. This includes the name of the collection and its schema, among other options.
